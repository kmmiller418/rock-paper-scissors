# ROCK PAPER SCISSORS

Check out the app [here](https://kmmiller418.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/)

A rework of an earlier assignment, this takes JS rock paper scissors and sticks it in the browser.

Current implementation accepts user input for name and associates it with a player object:

let p1 = {
    name: "",
    hand: "",
    score: 0
};

And allows players to choose from three onscreen buttons to play against the CPU.

### Next steps:
* ~~Visual representation of CPU hand~~ 4/3
* ~~Score counter + player information~~ 4/3
* Play until option
* Animations?
* Message when attempting to play without inputting name
