# ROCK PAPER SCISSORS

A rework of an earlier assignment, this takes JS rock paper scissors and sticks it in the browser.

Current implementation accepts user input for name and associates it with a player object:

let p1 = {
    name: "",
    hand: "",
    score: 0
};

And allows players to choose from three onscreen buttons to play against the CPU.

### Next steps:
* Visual representation of CPU hand
* Score counter + player information
* Play until option
* Animations?
